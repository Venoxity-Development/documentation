<Updates>
  <Update label="June 2024">
    ### Launch Week Highlights

    * Themes: Customize your styling with pre-configured themes. Just add the theme Quill, Prism, or Venus to your `mint.json` file and it'll update your docs styling.
    * Search V2: directly query OpenAPI endpoint descriptions and titles to reach API Reference pages, remove hidden pages from search, and enjoy our updated search bar UI.
    * Web Editor branching: create branches in our web editor without an IDE.
    * User Personalization: authenticate users with Shared Session or JWT so that you can show them customized content, such as pre-filling API keys or showing specific content for customers.
    * OepenAPI Automation Upgrades: to auto-populate API Playground pages, you can add an `openapi` field to an object in tabs or anchors arrays in the mint.json.
