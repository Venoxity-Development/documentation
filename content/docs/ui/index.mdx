This is your starting point to create beautiful, fast, and flexible documentation using **Fumadocs** and **Next.js**.

All your content lives inside the `/content/docs` directory — just open it up and start writing Markdown or MDX. You can organize your pages however you want, and Fumadocs will handle the navigation, layout, and styling for you.

## What's Next?

Start by exploring the official docs for both Fumadocs and Next.js. You'll get a better idea of what’s possible and how to customize everything from layouts to components.
