## Introduction

Large language models waste tokens crawling HTML, JS, and site chrome. By shipping a few simple endpoints, you can provide a more efficient way for LLMs to access your documentation.

1. **`/llms.txt`**: a concise sitemap with titles, URLs, and summaries
2. **`/llms-full.txt`**: a full Markdown dump of every document
3. **`/llms.mdx/*`**: the raw MDX/Markdown content of a requested page

## `/llms.txt`

- Lists each section and page in your documentation
- Includes optional one-line descriptions from frontmatter
- No boilerplate or stylingâ€”just the outline

```md
# Docs

## API Reference

- [Get museum hours](/docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours): No description available
- [Buy museum tickets](/docs/api-reference/tickets): No description available

## UI Framework

- [Quickstart](/docs/ui/quickstart): Start building awesome documentation in under 5 minutes
```

This file is generated at the root of your deployed site, enabling agents to discover it at `https://<your-domain>/llms.txt`.

## `/llms-full.txt`

- Concatenates the raw MDX/Markdown of every page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples, and frontmatter
- Lets an LLM ingest your entire documentation corpus in a single fetch

```md
# API Reference: Get museum hours

URL: /docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours
Source: content/docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours.mdx

## Operation: GET /museum-hours

...full MDX content...
```

This file is generated at build time by globbing `content/docs/**/*.mdx` and joining files in sidebar order.

## `/llms.mdx/*`

- Provides the raw MDX/Markdown content of a requested page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples, and frontmatter

Example: `/llms.mdx/ui`
