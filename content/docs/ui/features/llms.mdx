## Introduction
Large language models waste tokens crawling HTML, JS and site chrome. By shipping two simple Markdown files, you give AI agents exactly what they need:

1. **`/llms.txt`**: a concise site map with titles, URLs and summaries
2. **`/llms-full.txt`**: a full Markdown dump of every doc

This two-part pattern makes retrieval fast, reliable and predictable.

## `/llms.txt`

- Lists each section and page in your docs
- Includes optional one-line descriptions from frontmatter
- No boilerplate or styling, just the outline

```md
# Docs

## API Reference
- [Get museum hours](/docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours): No description available
- [Buy museum tickets](/docs/api-reference/tickets): No description available

## UI Framework
- [Quickstart](/docs/ui/quickstart): Start building awesome documentation in under 5 minutes
```

This file is generated at the root of your deployed site so agents can discover it at `https://<your-domain>/llms.txt`.

## `/llms-full.txt`

- Concatenates the raw MDX/Markdown of every page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples and frontmatter
- Lets an LLM ingest your entire corpus in one fetch

```md
# API Reference: Get museum hours
URL: /docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours
Source: content/docs/api-reference/operations/museum-hours.mdx

> No description available

## Operation: GET /museum-hours
...full MDX content...
```

This is generated at build time by globbing `content/docs/**/*.mdx` and joining in sidebar order.

## `/llms.mdx/*`

- Provides the raw MDX/Markdown of the requested page
- Preserves headings, paragraphs, code samples and frontmatter

Example: `/llms.mdx/ui`
```md
# UI Framework: Introduction
