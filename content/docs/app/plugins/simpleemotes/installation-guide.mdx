## Standard Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install **SimpleEmotes** into your GTA V game.

### 1. Download the Release
- Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page.  
- Unzip the archive and place the `SimpleEmotes` folder somewhere easy to find, like your Desktop.

### 2. Install the DLC Package
1. Navigate to:  
   ```
   SimpleEmotes/Required Content/DLC Package
   ```
2. Open **OpenIV** and enable **Edit Mode**.  
3. Go to:  
   ```
   mods/update/x64/dlcpacks
   ```  
4. Drag and drop the `animpack` folder into `dlcpacks`.  
5. Then navigate to:  
   ```
   mods/update/update.rpf/common/data
   ```  
6. Open `dlclist.xml` and add the following line **inside** the `<Paths>` section:  
   ```xml
   <Item>dlcpacks:/animpack/</Item>
   ```  
7. Save and close the file.

### 3. Install Game Files
1. Go back to the `SimpleEmotes` folder.  
2. Open:  
   ```
   SimpleEmotes/Grand Theft Auto V
   ```  
3. Select **everything** in that folder and copy it into your main GTA V game folder.  
   This includes files like:  
   ```
   Venoxity.Common.dll
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Animations Not Playing:** Make sure your game is updated and that the `animpack` is correctly installed in `mods > update > x64 > dlcpacks` with the proper `dlclist.xml` entry.  
- **Crashes on Launch:** Replace `Venoxity.Common.dll` with the latest version from the SimpleEmotes package.

## Known Conflicts

- **SimpleCTRL:** Uses an older `Venoxity.Common.dll` version. Only use one of these mods at a time.  
- **Simple Foot Controls:** May conflict with SimpleEmotesâ€™ crouch feature. Disable one mod to avoid overlapping controls.

## Additional Notes

- Always back up GTA V files before making changes.  
- Check the [Changelogs](/app/plugins/simpleemotes/changelogs) for version-specific installation instructions.
