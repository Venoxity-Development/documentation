## Setup your development environment

A minimum version of Node.js 18 is required. Note that Node.js 23.1 might have issues with the Next.js production build.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  ```bash tab="npm"
  npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter
  ```

```bash tab="pnpm"
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter --use-pnpm
```

```bash tab="yarn"
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter --use-yarn
```

```bash tab="bun"
npx create-next-app -e https://github.com/techwithanirudh/fumadocs-starter --use-bun
```

The Fumadocs template should now be initialized. You can start development!

### Start the development server

Run the app in development mode and open [http://localhost:3000/docs/app](http://localhost:3000/docs/app) in your browser.

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
    ```bash tab="npm"
    npm run dev
    ```

    ```bash tab="pnpm"
    pnpm run dev
    ```

    ```bash tab="yarn"
    yarn dev
    ```

    ```bash tab="bun"
    bun run dev
    ```

### Add your content

Fumadocs uses MDX for documentation, allowing you to write Markdown combined with React components. Add your content inside the `content/docs` directory. The structure is similar to a standard Next.js app, making it easy to navigate and manage your files. To learn more about MDX, check out the [MDX page](/docs/essentials/markdown).

Create your first MDX file in the `docs` folder:

```mdx title="content/docs/(index)/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo, what's up?
```

The app organizes content by concerns, e.g., `content/docs/api-reference`, `content/docs/app`, `content/docs/changelog`, etc.

## Deploy your changes

This template works out-of-the-box with Vercel or Netlify. You can deploy your documentation site with a single click.

### Docker Deployment

If you want to deploy your Fumadocs app using Docker with **Fumadocs MDX configured**, make sure to add the `source.config.ts` file to the `WORKDIR` in the Dockerfile.
The following snippet is taken from the official [Next.js Dockerfile Example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-docker/Dockerfile):

```zsh title="Dockerfile"
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies based on the preferred package manager
COPY package.json yarn.lock* package-lock.json* pnpm-lock.yaml* .npmrc* source.config.ts ./  # [!code highlight]
```

This ensures Fumadocs MDX can access your configuration file during builds.

## Update your docs

Add content directly in your files using MDX syntax and React components. You can use built-in components or create your own.
