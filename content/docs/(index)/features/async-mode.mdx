## Introduction

By default, all Markdown and MDX files must be precompiledâ€”even when running the development server. This requirement can increase startup time for large documentation sites.

To improve performance, this template enables **Async Mode** by default, allowing content files to be compiled at runtime instead.

## Constraints

Async Mode introduces some limitations to MDX features:

- **No import/export statements** are allowed inside MDX files. If you need to use custom components, pass them through the `components` prop instead.
- **Images must be referenced using URLs** (e.g. `/images/test.png`). Avoid relative file paths like `./image.png`. Place your images inside the `public` folder and reference them via their public URL path.
